# Angelo's README

## What is this???

This is a document I prepared, whose purpose is to give a few hints about myself and help the people who work with me.

It is an introduction on myself, my working style and principles. I try also to make it educating for anybody who might right it.

## Who am I

This guy here...

![angelos photo](angelos.jpg)

I live in Berlin with my wife Kim

and our son Giorgo

I was born and grew up in this [small place in Greece](https://goo.gl/maps/xev7eYvv7T32).
Some things I enjoy in life are
* Playing with Giorgo
* Books
* Coffee
* LISP
* Japanese food

## Why I am here, a.k.a my job

* <b>Attract, grow and retain great people.</b> If you feel that something is pushing you out, it would be amazing if you let me know in advance so I can help fixing it. I will buy you the best coffee in town for that, promise!
* <b>Talking with you!</b> It is one of my most important duties.
* Provide information and context.
* <b>Accept and provide feedback</b> in a productive manner that assists people to learn and grow.
* Support teams to be autonomous and produce consistently amazing output.
* Foster a culture of passion, craftsmanship, collaboration and pragmatism, resulting to products their builders are proud of.

## My job is not

* To tell you how to do your job. You are smart, you don't need me for this.
* To demotivate you. If I ever do so, please tell it to me and I will fix it as soon as possible.
* To put useless processes in place. If a process is in place, there should be a good reason. If you don't the reasons, let's talk about adapting or <i>eliminating</i> the process. <b>People > Process</b>

## How I can help you?

* <b>Information routing.</b> A big part of my job is being an information router within our domain and other projects and domains. I will update you as much as I can, but please feel free to ask anything you want to know about.
* <b>Firefight.</b> When things go south and we need a hand. Keep in mind everybody has flops from time to time and the shame is to hide them under the carpet than trying to resolve them and learn from them.
* <b>Drop in technical ideas and hints.</b> I am doing this job for 15 years now, from embedded to Petabyte-scale systems and nearly everything between. Sometimes I can drop a good idea that helps people get out of a tough spot. :P
* <b>Provide the view of the outsider.</b> I am not going to work on the code in a daily basis but still I will be close enough to provide some informed views.
* <b>Cheer, encourage and be there to discuss.</b> Part of my job is to be your supporter, promoter, ambassador and cheerleader.
* And <b>anything else</b> that you can come up with and I can do.

## How can you help me?

* Be self-driven.
* Do an amazing job.
* Keep politics out of the door, I really don't like them and it can only ruin our relationship. And by politics I mean not only with me but everybody else in the organization.
* Bring in your view, debate and disagree. Usually the best ideas and solutions come and evolve through debate. I will be challenging your ideas for the sake of bullet-proofing them and improving them.
* Keep your ego out of the door. I will make sure you will be treated and compensated fairly, while the results you produced will be credited to you and everybody will know about it.
  * Talk to me! Whenever you miss context, have questions or a problem just ping me. My order of preference for communication means is f2f > skype / hangouts > phone > email > sms > snail mail > telepathy.

## Why Klarna?

Why I decided to join Klarna? After working in many places I liked and I didn't like, I concluded we need to work in a place whose values and culture matches ours.

### Why join a specific company?

This is a difficult thing to identify as an outsider. Some hints I identified by trial and error.

* Learn about the founders (we are talking about startups, right?). Their personality transcends the company and it materializes as the company's DNA and culture. If you don't like what you see, don't bother.
*  Get LinkedIn Premium for a month or two. It will enable you to learn much more about the company and the people. E.g. the average turnaround rate, the trends in workforce size and so on. You will also be able to see the profiles of people working in the company.
* Learn about some of the individuals working in the company. Can you imagine yourself working with these people? You will be spending 40 hours per week with them and  they may end up being your friends. Do they look like  people you like to spend time with? You can conduct your research via LinkedIn, their personal blogs or other social and professional networks.
* Find out about the payscale. Do they underpay people (bad sign, that people are seen as tools). Do they overpay people (equally bad sign that favouritism and politics reign, or even worse, management is clueless).
* How does their office looks like? You can usually find photos online. Is it a place you like?

### Why join Klarna?

After this long introduction which explains things, the why Klarna part.

* The culture is result-driven and pragmatic.
* It is focused in being profitable, so it will be around for the forseeable future.
* I met many techies in Erlang Factory in Stockholm and I liked them ^^.
* Everybody I met (from senior management to junior developers) know what they are doing.

## What I value

* <b>Drive</b>, the most important attribute of all.
* <b>Empathy</b>, for our colleagues and our users. It former will make the personal and professional life of the people around us better (including ourselves), the latter will help us to deliver work-class products.
* <b>Focus</b> on doing the best work of your life.
* <b>Simplicity</b>. I have seen simplicity beating every other engineering approach again and again. Please KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid). You will also find it rewarding producing amazing results much faster than ever, by going simple.
* <b>Thinking</b>, in general. Most people seem to be in the autopilot. Please step back and think for a moment before you commit or decide.
* <b>Self reflection</b>, if you want to improve and enjoy your life, you will need to reflect.
* <b>Candor</b>, transparency and openess.

## 1o1s

* This is your meeting.
* Please spend some time before it and set the agenda. The agenda can include issues you face, short or long term goals, personal topics, pretty much anything you want to discuss and have another person's opinion.
* It is not a status update, unless you want it to be.
