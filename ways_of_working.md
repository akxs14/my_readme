# Ways of working in Engineering

During my career I observed a few things that work in technology organizations and many things that they don't. After assuming managerial duties, 
I thought a lot on how these lessons can be transmitted to the engineers. 

Following the [ideas of Charlie Munger](https://www.mymentalmodels.info/charlie-munger-mental-models/), I decided to incorporate them in a 
lightweight mental lattice that can be easily hold in mind during the daily development activities.

These models are listed below:

+ Spend time to think and discover different approaches and existing solutions before you start coding. 

+ The North Star is to write 0 lines of code per task. It will never happen but will help to avoid verbosity and the built-everything syndrome.

+ Consider build-vs-buy. Focus on building business logic instead of commoditized functionality.

+ Learn well what the cloud providers offer; it can save 80% of the coding.

+ Go for quality but no over-engineering.

+ Feature development shall always be decoupled from refactoring.

+ Be vocal when you have concerns, share them with your stakeholders.
